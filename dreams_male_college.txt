I was massaging my girlfriend's legs and for some reason her legs were completely covered with tattoos. The tattoos were of devils and snakes. I also remember that my girlfriend and I were talking in her car and she was being very cold and uncaring.

I was going on a blind date and the girl was beautiful. It seemed like everything was going good. Then all of a sudden we're walking and she ran into an old boyfriend. They went off together and left me there standing.

I was floating over my bed watching myself sleep. It was raining out but not over my house for some reason. In reality when I woke up my furniture was moved around and it was raining outside.

I had a dream that I was one of the paramedics at the car accident doing CPR on my friend. Only this time my friend lived. I can remember pushing on his chest, hearing his ribs snap, but because of this he survived.

I went back to an old place where I used to work. John's auto sales in Somerville. It was a cold winter night and I walked in and saw John and Charlie. We had some laughs, ate some pizza and drank some wine.

I dreamt that I was at my friend's house and I wet the bed (within the dream). When I woke up the bed was not wet.

I was trapped in some type of container and people kept walking by me and laughing. I tried to get out but I just couldn't. Finally when I started to fade off I jumped up and was awake.
