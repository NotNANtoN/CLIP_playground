Stars by the power of their orbit are stars in the order of the sun. But if they are not figures of orbit, they are not in the sun.  Exactly like me: by the power of my yearnings I am in the family. And if I will not yearn, I am not in the family.  Memories are a house. Time is a roof. All the time a roof. All the time time. I would like sometime to die unto them and see them.  Benno Rothenberg related that when he saw some archaeology, he had a feeling of homeland. As if he were in his house.  I do not deny that a man who reaches a certain age can no longer hope that those from whom he came will remain still alive with him, as my mother once  wrote to me in one of the letters of her twilight. From the fadings of her letters into the fatedness of man: But when can they. After all there's no chance of seeing you.  And once, in a discarded and forgotten letter: "Good night, Yehiel alter lebn. Slumber has descended upon me. I am caught in the throes of sleep.Khbin shlayferig gevorn." Said in a letter that nobody reads, that nobody read.  —February 8, 1989
It has never been so easy to cry openly or to acknowledge children. Never before could I walk directly to the center of an island city feeling the automatism of millions drawing one pious breath, shouldering the sunset, holding it up in the oily tree-line a while longer. Years ago, I was never sad enough and nothing but a hotel that I could tear to pieces and reconstruct inside a shoebox felt like home. My parents died. Their miserable possessions washed up in other hotels, dioramas of the febrile romantic.  I take my first lover, already gray at her temples and more reticent than shy, more tacit than admiring, to the bus stop by the Jewish Museum. We wait in the dark a long time. She does not kiss me. She hurries up out of the oily street onto the humming, fluorescent podium of the last bus where I see her a last time, not waving to me, not lovable, erect in the freedom we traduced years ago in our first kiss.  Never deny the power of withdrawal. Never doubt that thought and time make things small. Never refuse the easy exit line or prescribed uncomprehending gesture. At childhood’s end, none can tell happiness from buoyancy. None of it made any difference— the patricides, the hotels ill-constructed, the inconstant starlight of drugs and rebellion. We are no more complicated than our great-grandparents who dreaded the hotel life. Like them, we seek the refuge of warm days in January, a piety whose compulsion is to survive according to explicit laws no young woman adores or young man follows with darling hunger.
We wonder at our shifting capacities, keep adding and striking skills from the bottoms of our r é sum é s under constant revision like the inscriptions on tombs shared for generations unnervingly up to date  Made nervous by our shift in capabilities, we write:  I visited a country where kittens lay  dying under every bench, in every gutter, next to every  cigarette butt. One  made  me  weep. Two   made   me  worry.  Three   made   me look  away.  I  visited  a  city  with  very  few strays.  The   first   one   I   saw   I   adopted. What  could  it  mean? —posted by Sarah. 6.18.06  Hit “publish” and look away  The New Violence: I visited a country where everything looked like home
She was thinner, with a mannered gauntness as she paused just inside the double glass doors to survey the room, silvery cape billowing dramatically behind her.What’s this,  I thought, lifting a hand until she nodded and started across the parquet; that’s when I saw she was dressed all in gray, from a kittenish cashmere skirt and cowl  down to the graphite signature of her shoes. “Sorry I’m late,” she panted, though she wasn’t, sliding into the chair, her cape  tossed off in a shudder of brushed steel. We kissed. Then I leaned back to peruse my blighted child, this wary aristocratic mole.   “How’s business?” I asked, and hazarded a motherly smile to keep from crying out: Are you content to conduct your life as a cliché and, what’s worse,  an anachronism, the brooding artist’s demimonde? Near the rue Princesse they had opened a gallery cum souvenir shop which featured fuzzy off-color Monets next to his acrylics, no doubt,  plus bearded African drums and the occasional miniature gargoyle from Notre Dame the Great Artist had carved at breakfast with a pocket knife.  “Tourists love us. The Parisians, of course”— she blushed—“are amused, though not without a certain admiration ...” The Chateaubriand   arrived on a bone-white plate, smug and absolute in its fragrant crust, a black plug steaming like the heart plucked from the chest of a worthy enemy; one touch with her fork sent pink juices streaming.  “Admiration for what?” Wine, a bloody Pinot Noir, brought color to her cheeks. “Why, the aplomb with which we’ve managed to support our Art”—meaning he’d convinced  her to pose nude for his appalling canvases, faintly futuristic landscapes strewn with carwrecks and bodies being chewed  by rabid cocker spaniels. “I’d like to come by the studio,” I ventured, “and see the new stuff.” “Yes, if you wish ...” A delicate rebuff   before the warning: “He dresses all in black now. Me, he drapes in blues and carmine— and even though I think it’s kinda cute, in company I tend toward more muted shades.”  She paused and had the grace to drop her eyes. She did look ravishing, spookily insubstantial, a lipstick ghost on tissue, or as if one stood on a fifth-floor terrace  peering through a fringe of rain at Paris’ dreaming chimney pots, each sooty issue wobbling skyward in an ecstatic oracular spiral.  “And he never thinks of food. I wish I didn’t have to plead with him to eat ....” Fruit and cheese appeared, arrayed on leaf-green dishes.   I stuck with café crème. “This Camembert’s so ripe,” she joked, “it’s practically grown hair,” mucking a golden glob complete with parsley sprig onto a heel of bread. Nothing seemed to fill  her up: She swallowed, sliced into a pear, speared each tear-shaped lavaliere and popped the dripping mess into her pretty mouth. Nowhere the bright tufted fields, weighted  vines and sun poured down out of the south. “But are you happy?” Fearing, I whispered it quickly. “What? You know, Mother”—  she bit into the starry rose of a fig— “one really should try the fruit here.” I’ve lost her, I thought, and called for the bill.
I work all day, and get half-drunk at night. Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare. In time the curtain-edges will grow light. Till then I see what’s really always there: Unresting death, a whole day nearer now, Making all thought impossible but how And where and when I shall myself die. Arid interrogation: yet the dread Of dying, and being dead, Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.  The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse —The good not done, the love not given, time Torn off unused—nor wretchedly because An only life can take so long to climb Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never; But at the total emptiness for ever, The sure extinction that we travel to And shall be lost in always. Not to be here, Not to be anywhere, And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.  This is a special way of being afraid No trick dispels. Religion used to try, That vast moth-eaten musical brocade Created to pretend we never die, And specious stuff that says No rational being Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing That this is what we fear—no sight, no sound, No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with, Nothing to love or link with, The anaesthetic from which none come round.  And so it stays just on the edge of vision, A small unfocused blur, a standing chill That slows each impulse down to indecision. Most things may never happen: this one will, And realisation of it rages out In furnace-fear when we are caught without People or drink. Courage is no good: It means not scaring others. Being brave Lets no one off the grave. Death is no different whined at than withstood.  Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape. It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know, Have always known, know that we can’t escape, Yet can’t accept. One side will have to go. Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring Intricate rented world begins to rouse. The sky is white as clay, with no sun. Work has to be done. Postmen like doctors go from house to house.
For Phil Jackson The gym opened out before us like a vast arena, the bleached floorboards yawned toward a vanishing point, staggered seats high as the Mayan temple I once saw devoured by vines. Each of us was eaten up inside — all citizens of   lost and unmapped cities.  Frank hugged the pimply ball over his belly like an unborn child. Claire dressed for daycare in daffodil yellow and jelly shoes. David’s gaze was an emperor’s surveying a desiccated battlefield. Since he viewed everything that way, we all saw him the same.  The psych techs in Cloroxed white were giant angels who set us running drills, at which we sucked. The zones we set out to defend were watery at every edge. We missed close chest passes, easy combos. Our metronomes run different tempos, John proclaimed.  Then Claire started seeing dashes stutter through the air behind the ball. Then speed lines on our backs, and then her own head went wobbly as a spinning egg. She’d once tracked planetary orbits for NASA and now sat sidelined by her eyes’ projections.  Only Bill had game. Catatonic Bill whose normal talent was to schlub days in a tub chair — his pudding face scarred with chicken pox — using his hand for an ashtray, belly for an armrest. Now all that peeled away, and he emerged, clean as an egg.  He was a lithe and licorice boy, eeling past all comers, each shot sheer net. He faked both ways, went left. Beneath the orange rim his midair pirouettes defied the gravity that I could barely sludge through. He scored beyond what even Claire could count,  then he bent panting, hands on knees as the orderlies held out water cups, and the rest of us reached to pat his back or slap his sweaty hand, no one minding about the stench or his breath like old pennies. Then as quick as that he went.  Inside his head some inner winch did reel him back from the front of   his face bones where he’d been ablaze. He went back and back into that shadowed stare. Lucky we were to breathe his air. Breath is God’s intent to keep us living. He was the self   I’d come in  wanting to kill, and I left him there.
You had a woodchuck and an opium ball. The one ate through the furniture, the other sat in its cage depressing me. Now the woodchuck sheds its skin. I have a cow behind the Dollar Bin.  You shouldn’t drink diarrhea unless you bring enough for everybody. Turn it into a teaching moment. Asian-American Students for Christ have the room until 2:30.  Rumi says no donkey is a virgin, no, nor any beast that bites the grass. Maybe it sounds better in Persian. An unseen force propels the carts across the Whole Foods parking lot.  The woodchuck hasn’t been born yet I’d rather keep than you as a pet. You’ll sleep on wood shavings, I’ll comb your pelt. That animal loved you, his captor, whom he hated. I know just how he felt.
1    Kinship: Is embarrassing the wind, Like dead black boys, Falling down from the trees, Then downstream– On their knees, Blood like, Like a rich nation.  2    Metaphor: Becomes humiliating, And clean, Ticking like a ripe machine. Do not Bend, Fold, Or mutilate me– This is your future speaking.  3    The air smells so metaphysical We have accused it– Of smog, And lost manhood, Then all ritual.  4    Whoever wrote: A view is a mountain speaking But left the introduction For the snow, And accused silence Of its soul.  5    The whole nation: Is a stanza of blackness, A huge white whale, Faith in space (Like the newspapers), And the quiet insistence We have peace, And it’s your world, brother.
It was when they determined that I had been born dead That my life became easier to understand. For a long time, I wondered why rooms felt colder when I entered them, Why nothing I said seemed to stick in anyone’s ear, Frankly, why I never had any money. I wondered Why the cities I walked through drifted into cloud Even as I admired their architecture, as I pointed out The cornerstones marked “1820,” “1950.” The only songs I ever loved were filled with scratch, dispatches from A time when dead ones like me were a dime a dozen. I spent my life in hotels: some looked like mansions, Some more like trailer parks, or pathways toward A future I tried to point to, but how could I point, With nothing but a hand no hand ever matched, With fingers that melted into words that no one read.  I rehearsed names that others taught me: Caravaggio, Robert Brandom, Judith, Amber, Emmanuelle Cat. I got hungry the way only the dead get hungry, The hunger that launches a thousand dirty wars, But I never took part in the wars, because no one lets A dead man into their covert discussions. So I drifted from loft to cellar, ageless like a ghost, And America became my compass, and Europe became The way that dead folks talk, in short, who cares, There’s nothing to say because nobody listens, There’s no radio for the dead and the pillows seem Like sand. Let me explain: when you’re alive, As I understand it, pillows cushion the head, the way A lover might soothe the heart. The way it works for me, In contrast, is everything is sand. Beds are sand, The women I profess to love are sand, the sound of music In the darkest night is sand, and whatever I have to say Is sand. This is not, for example, a political poem, Because the dead have no politics. They might have A hunger, but nothing you’ve ever known Could begin to assuage it.
